# Qgoda

Qgoda (pronounce: yagoda!) is an extensible static site generator.

## Description

Qgoda is considered feature-complete but still under heavy development.

The documentation is currently being written.  You can check out the
current state at http://www.qgoda.net/.

## Main Features

Qgoda is comparable to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) but with a strong focus on:

- Flexible site structures with arbitrary taxonomies.
- Listings with pagination for arbitrary taxonomies and filters.
- Extensibilities with plug-ins written in Perl, Python, Ruby,
  or Java.
- Built-in multi-language features based on GNU gettext, both
  for template code and --- optionally --- for content.
- Integration of tools from the NodeJS eco system such as
  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/),
  [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/),
  [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/), [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/),
  ...
- Integration of arbitrary other tools and helpers.

## Template Languages

Qgoda uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
and the [Template Toolkit](http://www.template-toolkit.org/) by default for
processing content, although it is possible to change that.
