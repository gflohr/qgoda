v0.9.3 - 2018-11-01
	- Configuration validation is now using a JSON schema
	  (try "qgoda schema").
	- Validator is Ajv (https://ajv.js.org/), JSON schema version
	  "draft_07".  The validator is called with "coerceTypes" set
	  to "array", and "useDefaults".  That means that a lone string
	  value is automatically coerced into an array, where needed.
	- Replaced the underscore with a hyphen in all config variables,
	  so that "exclude_watch" is now for example "exclude-watch".
	- New commands "qgoda schema", "qgoda javascript", and "qgoda js"
	  (which is an alias for "qgoda javascript").
	- Gradually increasing test coverage (displayed on github page
	  https://github.com/gflohr/qgoda).
	- The i18n seed repo is now the official one (not file:///...).

	  (try asset.date.w3c, asset.date.rfc822, asset.date.w3cLocal,
	  and asset.date.rfc822Local)
	- yeoman generator (work in progress), see
	  https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-qgoda.
	- Plug-ins present in ./node_modules are automatically loaded.
	- Asset priority is now honored in all generation rounds.
	- Configuration variable "front_matter_placeholder" is now
	  "front-matter-placeholder" and an object.  The keys are the
	  chain name, and the value is the placeholder as a string.
	- The generator meta tag is now configurable in config.generator.
	- Added "Strip" to the default processor chains for discarding
	  leading and trailing whitespace from the generated files,
	  useful for XML output.
	- A new "xml" processor chain, defaults to ['TT2', 'Strip']
	- Non-standard strftime extension '#%' for the ordinal day
	  of the month (1st in English, 2eme in French, 3. in German),
	  PRs for other languages are welcome.
	- New location placeholder "basename_nodate" which strips of
	  leading YYYY-MM-DD- from the basename for Jekyll migration
