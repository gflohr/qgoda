- add context to PO entries inside markdown (requires a comment parser)
- complete computation of related documents
- Use seconds since the epoch as stringified version of Qgoda::Util::Date
- Markdown files have to end with an extra newline, otherwise the excerpt
  is not found (and other cases are broken, too).
- when merging configuration data into defaults, a wrong type will throw
  an exception (example: "helpers" is now a hash reference, not a list).
- do templates need access to "site"? Probably not.
- make all paths configurable!
- content is missing in dumps ;)
- excerpt didn't work on the qgoda-default site
- use Template::Stash for evaluating locations
- [% asset.date.ISODate %] must return 2011-10-05T14:48:00.000Z
- add support for variables {reldir} and {relpath} for location expansion.
  rationale: should be able copy _assets/images/* to /assets/images
- generalize the HTML cleaner into a plug-in interface!
- dependency URI is missing
- Template function that removes all markup.  This is needed for the
  <title> attribute that does not allow markup.
- rename outdir to sitedir
- consistency check for external plugin data
- informative verbose output, when compiling plugins
- Aria builder plug-in for aria enhancements
- Relative links must be possible so that qgoda content can be deployed into
  a document root subdirectory. HTML base attribute?
- just two lone --- lines do not work
- real implementation for slugify (language dependant)
- split up Qgoda::Util
