- Try to unfold arguments to virtual methods.  If that does not work,
  use either only named arguments or positional arguments.
- Important! /index.html must end up as /index.html not as /index/index.html
- concept for creation of automatic list pages
- rename outdir to sitedir
- refactor convertor to processor
- check for a YAML implementation before using Qgoda.
- processors should not directly depend on 3rd party modules, in particular:
  * Markdown
  * TT2
- Check what goes to stdout and what to stderr
- consistency check for external plugin data
- informative verbose output, when compiling plugins
- Aria builder plug-in for aria enhancements
- Ctrl-C no longer works
- Better location in TT error messages
- Error for list filters that are not taxonomies, or rather do not require
  configuration of taxonomies.
- Relative links must be possible so that qgoda content can be deployed into
  a document root subdirectory.
- q.include must merge the parent asset data! This is why the docs link
  does not work
- error messages from the template toolkit should have a line offset for the
  header applied.  Altertnatively, just add emtpy lines at the top, and
  remove them later.
- just two lone --- lines do not work
- arbitrary taxonomies (drop need to declare them first)
