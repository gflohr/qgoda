- q.link() should not die but warn only, or make it configurable
- q.link() and friends should accept a hash
- generalize the HTML cleaner into a plug-in interface!
- passing the command in the constructor is brain-damaged!
- also watch "_plugins"!
- dependency URI is missing
- why gets moose included? anyevent::filesys::notify ...
- Try to unfold arguments to virtual methods.  If that does not work,
  use either only named arguments or positional arguments.
  We need a utility function that creates a hash with named arguments
  like in the ImgSrcset plugin.
- Template function that removes all markup.  This is needed for the
  <title> attribute that does not allow markup.
- Important! /index.html must end up as /index.html not as /index/index.html
- concept for creation of automatic list pages
- rename outdir to sitedir
- refactor convertor to processor
- check for a YAML implementation before using Qgoda.
- processors should not directly depend on 3rd party modules, in particular:
  * Markdown
  * TT2
- Check what goes to stdout and what to stderr
- consistency check for external plugin data
- informative verbose output, when compiling plugins
- Aria builder plug-in for aria enhancements
- Ctrl-C no longer works
- Better location in TT error messages
- Error for list filters that are not taxonomies, or rather do not require
  configuration of taxonomies.
- Relative links must be possible so that qgoda content can be deployed into
  a document root subdirectory.
- q.include must merge the parent asset data! This is why the docs link
  does not work
- error messages from the template toolkit should have a line offset for the
  header applied.  Altertnatively, just add emtpy lines at the top, and
  remove them later.
- just two lone --- lines do not work
- arbitrary taxonomies (drop need to declare them first)
- strftime()
- real implementation for slugify (language dependant)
- option for taxonomies to be case-insensitive
- Important: Running templates twice through TT2 can be problematic if
  the first run produced TT2 code (try the INSERT directive!)
