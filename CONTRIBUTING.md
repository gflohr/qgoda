Contributions to qgoda are welcome.

It would be nice if you open an issue first if you plan to contribute new
features or want to make larger changes.  Qgoda is still under heavy
development and discussing such changes before implementing may help avoiding
frustrations.

If you don't want to contribute code, what about translating qgoda into your
language? It's really easy.
